# PMS Pads

## Project Overview
"PMS Pads" is a unique and humorous web-based service offering men a week-long studio rental during their partner's PMS. These studios feature a minimalist industrial design, a fridge stocked with favorite foods and drinks, a big TV, gaming consoles, and other amenities for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

## Features
- **Minimalist Industrial Design Studios**: Offering a calm and stylish environment.
- **Personalized Amenities**: Each studio is equipped with a variety of entertainment and comfort options.
- **Online Booking System**: Easy-to-use interface for checking availability and making reservations.

## Technologies
This project leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies for efficient full-stack web development:

- **NX**: NX is used for managing the monorepo structure of this project. It provides powerful tools for building and testing applications with a shared codebase, making it easier to maintain consistency and efficiency across the entire project.

- **React**: React, a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is chosen for developing the frontend. Its component-based approach allows for a modular and scalable structure, enabling us to create a dynamic and responsive user experience for the "PMS Pads" website.

- **NestJS**: For the backend, we are utilizing NestJS, an advanced Node.js framework. NestJS offers a robust platform for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. Its use of TypeScript and integration with modern Node.js features makes it an ideal choice for developing the backend services, APIs, and database interactions needed for this project.

## Installation
After cloning the repo, run `npm i` to install all nodejs packages required.

## Usage
To run the website locally for development execute:
